## current

Nothing planned.

## future considerations

- A “parse then make immutable” pattern for Request, Response, and Error
- The ability to add custom fields to Request, Response, and Error
  - This would allow for flexible usage with custom API:s
- Enforce that error codes fall within the standard reserved ranges
